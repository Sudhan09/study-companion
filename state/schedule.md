# Today's plan — 2026-06-05 (Phase 2 • Bootcamp Day 15 • Loop Week Day 5)

> **mode: loop_week** — Bootcamp curriculum (Phase 2, Days 22–42) is NOT today's driver.
> All content is Loop Foundations Boot Camp. Loop Week Day 5 is today's full day — carried from 2026-05-23, 2026-05-24, 2026-05-25, 2026-05-26, 2026-05-27, 2026-05-28, 2026-05-29, 2026-05-30, 2026-05-31, 2026-06-01, 2026-06-02, 2026-06-03, AND 2026-06-04 (no sessions any of those days per unchanged state files). **Thirteenth consecutive no-session carry. Fourteenth attempt day.**

> **Cross-check:** `progress_state.xml` `completed_through_day=21` ✅ matches `current_day.md.bootcamp.completed_through_day=21`. Curriculum sync: OK at 2026-06-05T08:32:15+05:30 (pipeline commit af63ff8bb6f0c06c75a126dba79705fd68dc4be8).

> **Note:** `bootcamp.current_day=15` (user-set on resume, 2026-05-10) is < `completed_through_day=21`. User-maintained — confirm or update when ready.

> **⚠️ STALE-INPUT (3 files — ALL >72h, beyond refuse threshold):**
> All three state files are beyond the 72h threshold. Values below are sourced from disk + last_session_summary reconciliation. Confirm nothing changed manually before treating as authoritative.
> - `state/current_day.md` — **~346h old** (last updated 2026-05-22T22:24:29+05:30) — **>72h threshold**
> - `state/active_weak_spots.md` — **~360h old** (last updated 2026-05-21T21:05:00+05:30) — **>72h threshold**
> - `state/last_session_summary.md` — **~346h old** (last updated 2026-05-22T22:24:29+05:30) — **>72h threshold**

> **⚠️ STATE DISCREPANCY — active_weak_spots.md vs last_session_summary.md:**
> `last_session_summary.md` (2026-05-22) + `room-to-improve/sessions/2026-05-22.md` record RTI changes NOT yet reflected in `active_weak_spots.md` (last written 2026-05-21). Confirmed changes:
> 1. **F1 escalated** watch → Band 2 active (confirmed — `mat`/`m` D.3.3 + `num`/`n` E.1.4, two define/use mismatches in drill blocks per RTI session file). File still shows "watch — escalation candidate."
> 2. **B2 graduated** — 5 clean no-bail sessions; `element_wise` bail impulse self-corrected. File still lists B2 as "Band 2 watch (improving), 4 clean sessions."
> 3. **A1 at 2/3 reps** — `factor_pairs` cold-clean on 2026-05-22 per RTI session. File still shows 1/3 reps.
> 4. **F3 — NOT graduated** (confirmed): earned 2 clean boundary reps (`is_prime` D.2.1 + symmetric-check), but same-session exponent re-fires (`**2` misread as square root; `a**a` instead of `a**2`) block the downgrade per RTI rules. Band 2 escalated status holds. Reps counter: 2 (was 0 in stale file). Graduation NOT awarded.
> All reconciled values applied in briefing below. **Update `active_weak_spots.md` at session start today.**

> **⚠️ Day 3 Block F mini-boss gate STILL OUTSTANDING (15th carry):** `diamond`, `is_palindrome_clean`, `compress` — skipped at 2026-05-21 and 2026-05-22 sessions; no sessions 2026-05-23 through 2026-06-04. Flag before Block A and let the user decide: attempt cold now or defer to end of Day 5. **Fifteen carries — this streak needs a named decision today, not another silent carry.**

> **⚠️ F1 at Band 2 active** (confirmed 2026-05-22 — `mat`/`m` D.3.3 + `num`/`n` E.1.4). F1 drill targets baked into Block A.6 and Block E.1.

## Topic

**Loop Week Day 5 — Functions DEEP + While Family + Nested-Loop Traps (Phase 3b L5+L6)**

*Theme:* The day functions stop being wrappers and become first-class tools. While-family of nested loops gets its own focused drill. 4 classic nested-loop traps get diagnosed cold. The day's payoff: function discipline IS the cure for the nested-loop traps — `return` beats flag-and-break, helpers beat shadowing, refactor beats `else` confusion.

*Split:* ~40% for, 60% while. Day 5 is the while counterbalance to Day 4's for-only pass.

*Source:* `instructions/loop_curriculum/loop_week_day_05.md` (synced).

## Block plan

- **Pre-Block gate (15 min) — Day 3 Block F check-in (15th carry):**
  Flag `diamond`, `is_palindrome_clean`, `compress`. User decides: attempt cold now or defer to end of day. Fifteen carries — log the decision regardless and name the streak.

- **Block A (1.5 hr) — Pure Functions, Multi-Return, Predicates, Scope, Type Hints:**
  - A.1 (15 min): Pure function discipline — input via param, output via return, no side effects. Drills: `count_evens`, bug-spot two impure functions.
  - A.2 (15 min): Multi-return via tuple. `find_extremes(lst)` returning `(min, max, mean)`. When to use tuple vs dict.
  - A.3 (15 min): Predicate pattern (`is_*`, `has_*`, `can_*`). Write 5 predicates (`is_prime`, `is_even`, `is_palindrome`, `has_vowels`, `is_sorted_ascending`). **F3 primary earn-back zone** — every boolean operator stated aloud before writing.
  - A.4 (15 min): Scope (LEGB) reinforcement. Shadowing trap. `global` (avoid). `nonlocal` preview.
  - A.5 (10 min): Type hints (light) — annotate earlier functions.
  - A.6 (20 min): Default arguments + mutable default trap. Fix: `None` sentinel. **F1 primary drill zone** — parameter naming vs internal loop variable naming rule: singular loop var, plural collection, never reuse param name as loop var.

- **Block B (1.5 hr) — Higher-Order Functions, Closures, Lambdas:**
  - B.1 (20 min): Higher-order functions — `apply_to_all`, `count_matching`, `find_first`. Functions as arguments.
  - B.2 (15 min): Lambda — syntax, constraints, when to use/not use. Sort by lambda, filter by lambda. **F3 watch** — operator in lambda predicates (`> 0`, `>= 2`, `% 2 == 0`) stated explicitly.
  - B.3 (15 min): `map`, `filter`, `reduce` — and why comprehensions usually win. `reduce` for product.
  - B.4 (25 min): Closures + function factories. `make_multiplier`, `make_validator`, `make_counter` with `nonlocal`. Late binding gotcha + default-arg fix.
  - B.5 (15 min): Lambda + closures. Refactor `make_validator` to lambda inside. `sorted` with closure over priority dict.

- **Block C (1.5 hr) — Phase 3b L5: While Family + Hybrid Loops:**
  - C.1 (30 min): `while` inside `while`. Inner-reset discipline. Drill: 4×3 grid, trace 3 broken snippets, nested multiplication table.
  - C.2 (20 min): `for` inside `while`. Sentinel outer + fixed inner. **A1 earn-back zone** — two-step body named in English before coding. Rep #3 of 3 toward Band 2 graduation (A1 currently at 2/3).
  - C.3 (20 min): `while` inside `for`. Fixed outer, convergence inner. Halving sequence, removing chars.
  - C.4 (10 min): Decision table — 4-cell lock (for+for, for+while, while+for, while+while).
  - C.5 (10 min): Range → while conversions. 3 drills cold.

- **Block D (1 hr) — Phase 3b L6: 4 Classic Traps + Function-Based Fixes:**
  - D.1 (40 min): All 4 traps — variable shadowing, `break` only exits inner, flag-and-break boilerplate, `for/while else` confusion. Each trap: run buggy → diagnose → fix by rename/function.
  - D.2 (10 min): The merger table — `return` as the systematic cure for all 4 traps.
  - D.3 (10 min): Performance awareness — O(n²) threshold table. Brute-force two-sum vs hash-map.

- **Block E (1 hr) — Wrap Block: `Pipeline` Class + `*args`/`**kwargs` + Decorators:**
  - E.1 (30 min): `Pipeline` class — fluent API, `return self` chaining, functions-as-data. 3 pipelines: numeric, string, filter+sum. **F1 discipline** — `self.steps` vs `step` in loop body: distinct names enforced.
  - E.2 (15 min): `*args` + `**kwargs` + call-site unpacking. `sum_all`, `make_record`, unpack list into function call.
  - E.3 (15 min): Decorators — light touch. Read + explain `@timer`. Write `@logger`. Optional bonus: `@memoize`.

- **Block F — Day 5 Mini-Boss (30 min), cold:**
  - Mini-Boss A: Hybrid halving — `for` outer + `while` inner. `[16, 7, 100, 1, 50]`, one sequence per line.
  - Mini-Boss B: Debug 4 broken nested-loop snippets. Trap diagnosis weighted heavily — 3/4 = fail.
  - Mini-Boss C: `count_matching` + `apply_to_all` higher-order pair, then compose them.
  - **Pass condition:** All 3 correct cold or ≤1 self-corrected bug per problem. Hints on >1 → loop back to Block C/D before Day 6.

## Active weak spots in scope today

- **F3** — Operator/condition confusion (Band 2 escalated, **2/2 boundary reps earned, NOT graduated**)
  → RTI session (2026-05-22) confirmed: earned `is_prime` D.2.1 + symmetric-check (both boundary-discipline reps), but exponent-face re-fired ×2 (`**2` misread as square root; `a**a` typo). Same-session re-fires block the downgrade per RTI rules. Still Band 2 escalated. **Primary drill target** → A.3 predicates + B.2 lambda predicates. Every operator/exponent decision stated aloud before writing.
  ⚠️ `active_weak_spots.md` stale (360h) — shows 0 reps; confirmed 2 reps from RTI session file.

- **A1** — Multi-step loop body (Band 2 escalated, **2/3 reps** — confirmed from RTI session 2026-05-22)
  → **Secondary drill target.** C.2 + C.3 hybrid loops — two-step body (check condition + transform/accumulate) must be named in English before coding. Rep #3 of 3 toward Band 2 graduation available in Block C.
  ⚠️ `active_weak_spots.md` stale (360h) — still shows 1/3 reps; confirmed 2/3 from RTI session.

- **F1** — Variable naming (Band 2 active — confirmed 2026-05-22 per RTI session; 0 clean reps since escalation)
  → **Active target.** A.6 (parameter naming vs internal names — default args context), E.1 (`self.steps` vs `step` in loop body). Rule: singular for loop variable, plural for collection, never reuse param name as loop var.
  ⚠️ `active_weak_spots.md` stale (360h) — still shows pre-escalation state ("watch — escalation candidate").

- **B2** — Bail to AI — **GRADUATED** per 2026-05-22 RTI session (5 clean sessions, `element_wise` bail self-corrected). Monitoring only.
  ⚠️ `active_weak_spots.md` stale (360h) — still lists B2 as active watch.

## Yesterday recap

**Note:** No sessions on 2026-05-23 through 2026-06-04 (state files unchanged since 2026-05-22). Last real session was 2026-05-22.

**Completed (2026-05-22 — Loop Week Day 4 second half):**
Block D locked (all 5 sub-stages): Range Tier 5, √n bound (`is_prime` + `factor_pairs` cold), exotic ranges, 6 anti-patterns + legit `range(len())` cases, 5 comp traps 7/7 cold. Block E locked: 10 functions + 9-method `MatrixOps` class — object/class wall climbed after ~6 re-angles, class runs end-to-end. Block F mini-boss PASSED: A (loop translations) rough (Loops 2/3/4 needed redos); B + C cold-clean.

**Unresolved (candidates for today's Pre-Block gate):**
- Day 3 Block F mini-boss gate (`diamond`, `is_palindrome_clean`, `compress`) — **fifteenth carry**.
- Output-paste discipline gap — code submitted without run output ~5× on 2026-05-22. Renew flag at day start.
- `active_weak_spots.md` needs update: F1 escalation to Band 2 active, B2 graduation, A1 at 2/3 reps, F3 at 2 earned reps / not graduated (all from 2026-05-22 session — file was last written 2026-05-21).
- Curriculum bug: `pythagorean_triples(20)` answer key omits `(12,16,20)` — upstream fix needed in pipeline repo.
